Single time: 377745
Double time: 768925
Total sequential time: 1146899
Single-precision time when using both cores: 254499
Double-precision time when using both cores: 768903
Total parallel time: 1023469

The results above were the results received when I ran my code using a friend's
Pi. On my own Pi, I received the results below when I ran the code:

Single time: 377745
Double time: 768925
Total sequential time: 1146899
Single-precision time when using both cores: 377726
Double-precision time when using both cores: 768903
Total parallel time: 1146706

This could potenitally be due to a faulty core on the Pi. I tried running my
code multiple times on my Pi and kept getting values very close to the ones
just mentioned, despite it running perfectly on a friend's Pi.
